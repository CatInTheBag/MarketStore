Explanation
1.Creation of class Owner, which will store basic information for the Owner ( Name only )

2.Creation of abstract class Card (our superclass), which will store information regarding the name of the owner, turnover 
for the previous month and the initial discount rate
All fields are private (encapsulation of data). We can get them only through getter and setter methods
We use class composition - class Owner 
we use abstract method getDiscountRate(), which must be implemented from the subclasses of class Card 
(BronzeCard,SilverCard and GoldCard)

3. Creation of class BronzeCard, which inherits from class Card
We implementat method getDiscountRate()
We use if else statement to implement the logic for the disctount method

4. Creation of class SilverCard, which inherits from class Card
We implementat method getDiscountRate()
We use if else statement to implement the logic for the disctount method

3. Creation of class GoldCard, which inherits from class Card
We implement method getDiscountRate()
We use if else statement to implement the logic for the disctount method

4. We create class Purchase
The constructor of the class use two paramethers.First one is the card, second one is the current purchase
We make methods to get the purchase value, to get the discount rate, the discount sum and the final sum that 
must be paid
We ovveride the toString method, in order to give the needed information for each purchase made from our clients

5.We create class PayDesk, this is where our main method is
We create 3 cards for Bruce, Jan and Alfred and give the turnover for each client for the previous month

We use ArrayList data structore to store every purchase made. 
At the end we use the method printInformation() to get the needed information.
We use polymorphism to get the needed information.
